#Casper
*(for Wordpress)*

Inspired by the [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blogging platform, Casper is a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) port of the default theme by the same name. The goal of this project is to emulate the gorgeous theme while taking advantage of features exclusive to the Wordpress framework.

##Usage

Download the [zip](https://github.com/lacymorrow/casper-wp/archive/master.zip) package of the theme and install either automatically through the Wordpress Dashboard > Appearance tab, or by uploading the `casper-wp` folder to your Wordpress/wp-content/themes directory.
